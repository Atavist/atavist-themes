# Developing with Atavist

Atavist is a consumer publishing platform, one that doesn’t require users to write a single line of code in order to make something great. With a little elbow grease, though, almost any aspect of an Atavist project is customizable. 

A project on Atavist isn’t defined by a monolitic template, but is the result of a combination of modular pieces. The most important of these are accessible to developers: 

- **Theme**. A project’s theme determines its appearance: the spacing of elements, its typographic character, its color palette, and other aspects of its look and feel. To learn about developing themes, see [Custom themes](https://github.com/Atavist/developer/wiki/Custom-themes). 
- **Blocks and title designs**. Blocks allow for images, videos, charts, and anything else you can imagine to be included within projects. Title designs allow for projects to feature beautiful title layouts, from the understated to the eye-catching. To learn about making your own, see [Custom blocks and title designs](https://github.com/Atavist/developer/wiki/Custom-blocks-and-title-designs).
