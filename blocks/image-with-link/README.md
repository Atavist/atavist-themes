# Image With Link

This sample block demonstrates how to create a linked image. The block is nearly identical to the default Atavist Image block, with the addition of a URL field. If the URL is set, the image will be a link to it. A second option allows specifying if the URL should be opened in a new window or not. 

To install this block, create a new custom block and paste the contents of the following files into the code blocks:

- [HTML](index.html)
- [Javascript](script.js)
- [Sass](style.css)
- [Field Definitions](fields.json)

Alternately, download [this zip](image-with-link.zip) and drag it onto the _Import_ button on the newly created custom block page.
