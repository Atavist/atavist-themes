# Autoplay Video

This sample block demonstrates how to create an autoplaying video. The block is nearly identical to the default Atavist Video block, except that uploaded videos will autoplay when they scroll into view and will return to a paused state when they scroll out of view. Note that the same behavior will _not_ occur with YouTube and Vimeo videos.

To install this block, create a new custom block and paste the contents of the following files into the code blocks:

- [HTML](index.html)
- [Javascript](script.js)
- [Sass](style.css)
- [Field Definitions](fields.json)

Alternately, download [this zip](autoplay-video.zip) and drag it onto the _Import_ button on the newly created custom block page.
